
Overview

  This software searches {{{http://www.flickr.com}Flickr}} for photos
  taken with your stolen camera. It works by searching for photos with
  your camera's serial number in the
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format}EXIF}}
  data. Note that not all cameras expose the serial number in the EXIF data.

  I'm currently working on a new version that aims to find stolen cameras even faster.

Development

  The project is currently hosted on Google Code {{{http://code.google.com/p/stolencamerafinder/}here}}.
  Feel free to check out the source and build it with {{{http://maven.apache.org/}Maven}}.
